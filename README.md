**Simple, Scalable, Type-Safe, Resolver-First GraphQL Schema Construction**

Greetings!! If you are reading this then you've heard of GraphQL Nexus from a talk or found it from another open source project which uses it. This is just a quick note that GraphQL Nexus is still very much under development and isn't yet ready for prime-time, though it's getting close!

If you're interested in following along with the progress, feel free to star and/or watch the repo.

If you'd like to contribute, **checkout the [develop](tree/develop) branch** where you can browse through the source code and follow the instructions for building the docs, getting started, etc.
